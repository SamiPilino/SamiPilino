- 👋 Greetings, I’m @SamiPilino! I'm a recent college graduate looking for software engineering opportunities.
- 🥅 My goal is to use software to analyze, describe, and stabilize dynamic systems.
- ⚙️ I've done some work with embedded systems, AI robots, operating systems, distributed systems.
- 🌐 I've also worked on a few websites using tools such as React.js and Redux, Svelte, Node.js and Express.js, Axios, MongoDB, and SQL but I prefer working on the business logic over UI/UX type work.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning new business models for the future of work.
- 👨🏾‍💻 I’m looking to collaborate on all sorts of types of projects! I'm sort of still testing the waters to see where I fit into in the software industry.
- 👀 Watch my Twitch stream, @samipilino, where I will work on all sorts of projects such as:
  - Operating Systems, FPGA's, and Embedded Devices
  - Tonnetz Hyperspheres for software generated music
  - Significance Autoscaling for a schoolwork pipeline designed to prevent procrastination
  - Custom Linux distros
  - Project Management tools
  - ...and much more!
- 📫 You can also reach me on Twitter at @PilinoSami or on Instagram at @samipilino.
